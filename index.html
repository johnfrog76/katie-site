                        <p>Katie Webster is an American saxophonist, composer, and improviser from Seattle,
                        Washington. Her music captures a raw and expressive approach to improvisation and explores
                        a spectrum of distinctive soundscapes through layers of playful and often dissonant
                        counterpoint.</p>
                        
                        <p>A 2022 graduate of the Berklee College of Music, Webster went on to pursue her
                        master&rsquo;s degree at the Global Jazz Institute, studying with artists such as Danilo Pérez, Joe
                        Lovano, John Patitucci, Dave Liebman, Gary Bartz, and Tia Fuller. She is the 22nd recipient and
                        first female awardee of the prestigious Jimmy Lyons Scholarship, presented by Berklee in
                        conjunction with the Monterey Jazz Festival. At Berklee, she was accepted for several
                        collaborative musical programs including the Institute of Jazz and Gender Justice, where she
                        had the opportunity to learn from celebrated musicians Terri Lyne Carrington, Kris Davis, Linda
                        May Han Oh, and Val Jeanty. Webster also studied privately with Tony Malaby, George
                        Garzone, Godwin Louis, Marquis Hill, and Francisco Mela.</p>
                        
                        <p>In October 2022, Webster was commissioned by the Mass Art Art Museum to write and
                        perform a composition inspired by the life and contributions of Elizabeth “Mumbet” Freeman.
                        She premiered her work in collaboration with Joana Vasconcelos&rsquo; Valkyrie Mumbet, a
                        large-scale multimedia installation, performing her composition alongside JGJ mentors Terri
                        Lyne Carrington and Kris Davis. Webster has performed as a featured soloist with the Seattle
                        Repertory Jazz Orchestra, and in the Conservatorium van Amsterdam Keep an Eye Large
                        Ensemble alongside featured artist Dick Oatts. Webster has been invited to perform as part of

                        Jazz Orchestra at the Lionel Hampton Jazz Festival.</p>

                        <p>Webster&rsquo;s recent performance highlights include the Bern International Jazz Festival,
                        Vermont Jazz Festival, Monterey Jazz Festival, and Lincoln Center. Webster currently resides in
                        Boston, where she studies and performs around the east coast. Fascinated by the relationship
                        between music, storytelling, and visual media, she is currently working on her first EP consisting
                        of interdisciplinary tributes to women activists throughout history.</p>
